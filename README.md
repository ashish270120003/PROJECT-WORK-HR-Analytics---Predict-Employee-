## üß™ Project Workflow

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Department-wise attrition analysis
- Salary band distribution and its relation to attrition
- Impact of promotions and years at company on attrition
- Correlation heatmaps and feature distributions

2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (if required)
- Train-test data split

 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built classification models using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

 4. SHAP Value Analysis
- Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions
- Identified most influential features contributing to attrition

 5. Visualization with Power BI
- Created a dashboard to present:
  - Attrition trends by department and salary band
  - Attrition rate vs. promotion history
  - KPIs for HR insights and actionables
